# BEAT
HELCOM Biodiversity Assessment Tool (BEAT) is used for integrated assessments of biodiversity in the Baltic Sea. The tool, BEAT 3.0<sup>[1](#references)</sup>, was initially developed in the [BalticBOOST](https://github.com/NIVA-Denmark/BalticBOOST) project and used in the [State of the Baltic Sea - Second HELCOM Holistic Assessment 2011-2016](http://stateofthebalticsea.helcom.fi/). Here, BEAT is updated for use in the Third HELCOM Holistic Assessment of the Baltic Sea (HOLAS III), with contributions from the HELCOM BLUES and the Baltic Data Flows projects.
